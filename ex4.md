 Exercise 4
## Q1. Algorithm
    - Enter the building.
    - Start at the ground floor.
    - Head to the first floor
    - Follow the sign "EY 100-130".
    - Enter each room sequentially until you find EY128.
## Q2. Steps
    - Each step involves moving from one room to another.
    - It would take 13 steps to reach EY128.
## Q3
    - This is neither a best-case nor a worst-case scenario.
## Q4
    - Best case: EY128 is the first room you enter on the first floor.
    - Worst case: EY128 is the last room you enter on the first floor.
## Q5
    If you memorize the layout:
        - Start at the ground floor.
        - Skip to the first floor.
        - Proceed directly to EY128.
    This technique eliminates unnecessary steps.
